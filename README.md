# howto-cli

This is a simple script to allow better searching of the [howto.txt](github.com/alexk49/howto.txt) format.

You may need to change the permissions of the script:
```
chmod u+x howto.sh
```

## Tips and tricks

Add an alias to your .bashrc:

```
alias ht='path/to/your/howto.sh'
```

I use ht as in "howto" but you can obviously use whatever you woud like. 

This then allows searching the file with:

```
ht search +vim
```
